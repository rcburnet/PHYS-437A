Hi Robert,

Sorry for the delay. Since this is due on Monday night, I'll keep it brief.


General Instructions:

- 437 weekly assignments are due to me the day *before* we meet, so I have time to read them. Realistically, the latest this can be is 10 pm the night before. 
- please write up answers to assignments fully in latex; this way you can easily incorporate them into your final write-up
- in general, I expect properly formatted plots, references, etc; if you don't know how to do this in latex we can discuss it on Tuesday


For Tuesday:

By way of introduction to the project, please reread Ryan's paper, and look things up on the web in order to answer the following questions. I expect roughly one paragraph of writing for each answer, in latex, with URLs/references.

1) what is the SDSS survey? (give a 1 paragraph summary)
2) what data did Ryan Speller get from SDSS?
3) what is the ALTAS3D survey?
4) what data did he get from ATLAS3D?
5) what are the different data releases of SDSS? which did Ryan use, how many have there been since, and what is in them?
6) how does one query the SDSS catalogue?

If you get stuck let me know.

Thanks,
James
